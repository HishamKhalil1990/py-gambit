# Midterm-Project


## Cooperation Plan

- **What are the key strengths of each person on the team?**
Aseel -> Good analytical skills and conceptual thinking.
Hamzh -> Good debugging skills.
Hisham -> Good planning skills and strategic thinking.
Reema -> Good organizational skills.
Yahya -> Good trouble shooting skills and positive energy.

- **How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?**
Having team members with good planning, strategic thinking and organizational skills will empower our team to have an efficient project plan especially in the early stages.
Also, having members with good analytical skills will help us define our problem domain and to visualize the parts of the solution beforehand, and to provide the best strategy to handle the problem.
Finally, having memebers in our team with good debugging and trouble shooting skills will help us solve errors/bugs in a timely manner and contribute to better optimize the solution.

 
- **In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?**
We have room to improve ourselves in time and task management also in decision making relating to choosing the most convenient algorithm and in our testing skills. 

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
We plan on scheduling stand up meetings daily to divide the tasks and responsibilities for each team memeber, review previous work and also discuss any challenges we face.



## Conflict Plan

- **What will be your groupâ€™s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**
Firstly after meeting in a zoom call were all team memebers are present we will look for the branch with the issue and compare the last commit with the currnt work and decide on which parts to keep and which to remove.

- **What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**


- **How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?


- **How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?


- **How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
